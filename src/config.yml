#This config file contains the information about the different arenas. It is very important that only the names and display items of the arenas are changed.
#Do not edit this file without knowing what you are changing as this could - and probably WILL! - cause errors within the plugin.

#As a side note, locations are not stored as X,Y,Z float or int values. They are stored using the Location object within Bukkit - if you were curious... ;p
